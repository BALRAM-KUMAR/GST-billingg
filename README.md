The steps you've outlined seem to cover the setup and running of the GST Billing website. Let me break it down for clarity:

1. Download Repository:
   Download the GST Billing website repository from GitHub. (https://github.com/BALRAM-KUMAR/GST-billingg/)
2. Open in Code Editor:
   Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code to work with the downloaded files.
3. Navigate to Project Directory:
   Open a terminal within Visual Studio Code.
   Navigate to the main folder of the GST Billing website (GST-billingg) using the terminal or command line.
4. Install Dependencies:
   Run the command npm install i or npm i in the terminal to install the necessary project dependencies based on the package.json file.
5. Run the Development Server:
   After installing dependencies, start the development server by running the command npm run dev. This command might initiate the server and make the website accessible locally.
6. Access the Website:
   Once the server is running, open a web browser and go to the specified local address provided by the development server, typically something
   like http://localhost:5173/.
   This address should display the GST Billing website running on your local machine.
